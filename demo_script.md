# Demo Video Script & Walkthrough

Use this script to record your 2-minute demo video for the submission.

## 1. Introduction (0:00 - 0:20)
*   **Action**: Show the "Employee Chat" screen.
*   **Script**: "Hi, I'm [Your Name]. This is my submission for the 48-Hour AI Agent Development Challenge: The **HR Assistant Agent**. It's an intelligent tool designed to instantly answer employee questions about company policies using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model."

## 2. Core Feature: Policy Q&A (0:20 - 0:50)
*   **Action**: Type a question like: *"How many annual leaves do I get?"* or *"What is the travel allowance?"*
*   **Script**: "As you can see, the agent retrieves the exact information from the company handbook. It knows about our specific policies, like the 27 days of annual leave and the travel limits."

## 3. Advanced Feature: Voice Interface (0:50 - 1:10)
*   **Action**: Click the **Microphone** icon in the sidebar. Say: *"Tell me about the maternity leave policy."*
*   **Script**: "I've also implemented a Voice Interface. Employees can simply ask questions verbally, and the agent transcribes and answers them instantly."

## 4. Advanced Feature: Email Drafter (1:10 - 1:30)
*   **Action**: Click the **"Email Drafter"** tab.
*   **Action**: Enter "Manager Name", select "Sick Leave", and type "High fever for 2 days". Click **Draft Email**.
*   **Script**: "Another cool feature is the Email Drafter. It automatically generates professional emails based on company policy. Here, it drafted a sick leave email citing the correct policy clause."

## 5. Advanced Feature: Admin Dashboard (1:30 - 1:50)
*   **Action**: Switch to **HR Admin** in the sidebar. Enter password `admin123`.
*   **Action**: Edit the text (e.g., change "Gym membership" to "Gym and Spa membership"). Click **Save Changes**.
*   **Action**: Switch back to **Employee Chat** and ask: *"What wellness benefits are available?"*
*   **Script**: "Finally, there's an Admin Dashboard for HR teams. They can update policies in real-time. I just added 'Spa membership', and the agent immediately picked up the change without any code deployment."

## 6. Conclusion (1:50 - 2:00)
*   **Action**: Show the GitHub repo or the Architecture diagram (if you have one).
*   **Script**: "The agent is built with Streamlit and uses a RAG-lite architecture. It's secure, fast, and easy to maintain. Thank you for watching!"
